Water-cooled is an experimental design for a water-cooled Ormerod extruder.

554.1-extruder-drive-pneumatic.fcstd Is a modified Ormerod extruder drive block that takes M6 4mm pneumatic fittings instead of the old Ormerod Bowden start. Carefully clean the M6 thread with an M6 tap and blow through before using.

554.2-extruder-drive-pneumatic.fcstd is a modified version of 554.1 .  It also has a larger diameter (3mm) input hole so a filament guide PTFE tube can be run all the way round the corner to give low friction. 

528.4 Ormerod 2.fcstd is the whole of Ormerod as a FreeCAD model.

1079.1-quickset-nozzle-mount.fcstd is a design for a hot end mount with an extra tab useful for a cable tie.

PTFE-guide-tube-holder.fcstd is a guide for 2 4mm diameter PTFE Bowden tubes.
